## Professional Practice for Game Development
### (For module CMP4271 Professional Practice for Game Development)

**Project description:** Over the course of the module we had to develop the core transferable skills for creating and developing ideas for games. Each wee we would be given a short brief and put into different teams and we must then work as teams to create a prototype of a game that fits to brief in a short period of time and then present it to the rest of the class
Throughout this period of time we also created short week by week analysis reports on those lessons and our experiences working in the given teams and the brief and for the final submission of the module we created a report based upon those week by week documents.

## Post Module Thoughts
Overall this module taught me the fundamentals towards building a good approach to working as teams and developing ideas from simple thoughts and concepts to actual playable prototypes. Along with this, the module also helped to develop my confidence in presenting ideas to larger groups of people and showing work to people to recieve constructive critisisms towards my development approach to help me improve for the next week.
The main impact this module has had on me is the confidence to find an appropriate development strategy for what I want to create and ensure that I can exzplain it clearly to others.
