## CGI Modelling
### (For module DIG4165 CGI Modelling)

**Project description:** The project for this module was to create and render both an environment scene and create and render a character from scratch using Autodesk Maya as the software for the assessment. The environment was to be created using refference imagery and the character was to be designed from scratch and created from the sketches.

**My Work:** For the environment I recreated Balmora, a fictional town from The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, by using a mixture of design art from the environment and screenshots pulled from the game and for the character I created an evil looking robot from my sketches

## Post Module thoughts
This module was my first introductiuon into any form of 3D modelling and rendering and scince then I have continued to develop my abilities in 3D modelling and have also learned more 3D software i.e. Blender and I will use these transferable skills to keep creating 3D models for game development
